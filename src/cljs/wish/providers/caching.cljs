  "Take from the channel as <!, but give up after a timeout. In some slow
   networks (like when on the subway) it may seem that we're fetching, but
   (especially in cases like gapi init) it may effectively never complete,
   and our service worker may not be able to do anything about it (for example,
   service worker can timeout the core gapi lib, but has no jurisdiction over
   the libs it subsequently tries to load).

   By timing out at the cache layer, we can share this functionality across
   things that we want cached and let the Providers not have to worry about
   timeouts.
